<p>One last thing I would like to mention before I am going to wrap this section up is Unix philosophy. In the core of Unix philosophy is simplisity. Here three dot points that summary Unix philosophy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every tools and/or command made to do one simple task</li>
<li>Many different commands can be joined together into one super command</li>
<li>Therefore number of different commands combination is limited by your imagination</li>
</ul>
<p>Command-Line interface is super, super easy. I personally find CLI to be much more intuitive then GUI, not because I have experience in it, rather because I understand how to find help. I always find help in either of these three places:</p>
<p>The thing about CLI that scares people the most isn’t the fact that it is black screen or unfamiliar environment rather lack of drop downs, buttons and tick boxes. CLI has all of those options in one format and in one place, but you need to ask for them using keyboard.</p>
<p>GUI in its nature is very redundant. It will always have more than one way of doing the same thing e.g “toolbar” is just a set of shortcuts, but there is a tools bar at the top, left right and bottom, plus the right click all leading you to the same, one place.</p>
<p>For me Bioinformatics and CLI isn’t about remebering all the tools and commands and they options, but about understanding how to ask the question and how quickly filter through the answer. And I want to share this with you.</p>
